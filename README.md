## Background

Congratulations on your new job! As the new lead analyst for the New York Citi BikeLinks to an external site. program, you are now responsible for overseeing the largest bike-sharing program in the United States. In your new role, you will be expected to generate regular reports for city officials looking to publicize and improve the city program.

Since 2013, the Citi Bike program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Each month, bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike DataLinks to an external site. webpage.

However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have questions about the program, so your first task on the job is to build a set of data reports to provide the answers.

## Instructions
Your task in this assignment is to aggregate the data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs and find two unexpected phenomena.

Design 2–5 visualizations for each discovered phenomenon (4–10 total). You may work with a timespan of your choosing. Optionally, you can also merge multiple datasets from different periods.

Use your visualizations (not necessarily all of them) to design a dashboard for each phenomenon. The dashboards should be accompanied by an analysis explaining why the phenomenon may be occurring.

Create one of the following visualizations for city officials:

Basic: A static map that plots all bike stations with a visual indication of the most popular locations to start and end a journey, with zip code data overlaid on top.

Advanced: A dynamic map that shows how each station's popularity changes over time (by month and year). Again, with zip code data overlaid on the map.

The map you choose should also be accompanied by a write-up describing any trends that were noticed during your analysis.

Create your final presentation:

Create a Tableau story that brings together the visualizations, requested maps, and dashboards.

Ensure your presentation is professional, logical, and visually appealing.

## Analysis
On User Dashboard, as depicted in the above charts, indicates that for 2018-2021 subscribers are the main user types of Citi bike and among the users, Male is the major user group. 

On Trip Analysis Dashboard, Total Trips by Year& by Month reveals that the highest usage of bicycles occurs during the summer months of July, August, and September, in comparison to the winter months. And bicycle usage peaked in 2019, while a marked decrease was observed in 2020, which may be due to pandemic restrictions at the same period.

On Top Stations Dashboard, it indicates that City Hall is the most frequently used station to start trip and Grove St PATH is the most frequently used station for ending trips.

On the Station Map Dashboard, it shows the most frequently used stations are primarily in the zip codes 07302 and 07310. It indicates that the residents of Jersey City are most likely utilizing the bicycle-sharing service for daily commutes, which is potentially due to its cost-effectiveness when compared to other transportation options.
